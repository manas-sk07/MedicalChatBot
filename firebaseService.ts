The error "TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The 'payload' argument must be of type object. Received null" within the Firestore client, often preceded by source map warnings, usually indicates an issue with authentication or permissions when trying to access Firestore, even if the immediate JavaScript error points elsewhere. The `console.error` line in `getUserAnalyses` is just where the error is being logged after it bubbles up from the Firestore client.

Here's the most common cause and how `firebaseService.ts` is typically set up for server-side Firebase Admin SDK usage:

**Likely Cause: Firebase Admin SDK Initialization or Authentication**

The Firebase Admin SDK (used in `firebaseService.ts` for server-side Firestore access) needs to be properly initialized with credentials that have permission to read/write to your Firestore database. If this initialization is missing, incorrect, or the service account lacks permissions, you'll get errors like this.

While your `firebaseService.ts` *does* have an `initializeApp()` call, how it gets its credentials depends on the environment:

1.  **Local Development (outside Google Cloud):**
    *   You MUST download a service account key JSON file from your Firebase project settings (Project settings -> Service accounts -> Generate new private key).
    *   You MUST set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the *absolute path* of this downloaded JSON file.
        ```bash
        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/serviceAccountKey.json"
        ```
    *   Then, `initializeApp();` (with no arguments) will automatically pick up these credentials.

2.  **Google Cloud Environments (Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, App Engine):**
    *   These environments often provide "Application Default Credentials" (ADC) if the runtime service account has the necessary IAM roles (e.g., "Cloud Datastore User" or "Firebase Admin" for full access).
    *   In this case, `initializeApp();` (with no arguments) *should* work out of the box.

3.  **Explicit Credential Initialization (Less Common for `initializeApp()` without args):**
    *   If you weren't using ADC or `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, you would initialize like this:
        ```typescript
        // src/services/firebaseService.ts
        import { initializeApp, getApps, cert } from 'firebase-admin/app';
        // ... other imports

        // Make sure this path is correct or load the JSON content directly
        // const serviceAccount = require('/path/to/your/serviceAccountKey.json');

        if (!getApps().length) {
          // Option A: From a file (ensure the path is correct and accessible by the server)
          // initializeApp({
          //   credential: cert('/path/to/your/serviceAccountKey.json'),
          // });

          // Option B: Directly from the JSON object (if you import/require it)
          // initializeApp({
          //   credential: cert(serviceAccount),
          // });

          // Option C: Relying on GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS or ADC (current setup)
          initializeApp();
        }
        // ... rest of the file
        ```

**The error `Request failed with status code 500` when refreshing an access token strongly points to an authentication/authorization problem at the Google Cloud level.**

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Verify `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` (Local Development):**
    *   **Is the environment variable set correctly in the terminal where you run `next dev`?** Double-check the path.
    *   Does the service account JSON file exist at that path?
    *   Does the service account associated with that key have the necessary Firestore permissions (e.g., "Cloud Datastore User" or "Firebase Rules User" if using security rules, or "Firebase Admin" for broader access) in the Google Cloud IAM console for your project?

2.  **Verify Service Account Permissions (Google Cloud Hosted):**
    *   If deployed to Cloud Run, Functions, etc., check the IAM roles of the *runtime service account* for that service. It needs Firestore access.

3.  **Check Firestore Rules:** While Admin SDK usually bypasses Firestore security rules by default, if you have very specific rules or are somehow forcing rule evaluation, ensure they aren't blocking access. (This is less likely with the Admin SDK).

4.  **Restart Development Server:** After setting/changing environment variables, always restart your Next.js development server.

5.  **Test Firestore Access Directly:**
    You could add a very simple, temporary test function in `firebaseService.ts` to isolate Firestore connectivity:
    ```typescript
    // Add this temporarily in firebaseService.ts
    export async function testFirestoreConnection() {
      try {
        const testDoc = await db.collection('test_collection').doc('test_doc').get();
        console.log('Firestore connection test successful:', testDoc.exists);
        return true;
      } catch (e) {
        console.error('Firestore connection test FAILED:', e);
        return false;
      }
    }
    ```
    Then call this from a server component or API route to see if basic connection works.

Given the error you're seeing, the problem isn't with the `console.error` line itself but with the `await userDocRef.collection(type).orderBy('timestamp', 'desc').get();` call failing due to an underlying authentication or permission issue with Google Cloud services.

Since your `firebaseService.ts` already uses `initializeApp();` which relies on Application Default Credentials (ADC) or the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable, the most likely scenario is that:
    a.  If running locally, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is not set, not pointing to a valid service account key file, or the service account lacks permissions.
    b.  If running in a Google Cloud environment, the runtime service account for your Next.js app doesn't have the required IAM permissions for Firestore.

**No code changes are being made to `firebaseService.ts` itself because the existing `initializeApp();` is the correct way to initialize when using ADC or the environment variable.** The fix lies in configuring your environment correctly.
